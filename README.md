The project is based on the automated attendance system. It takes into consideration that with increase in batch sizes of university and conventional techniques still in place, attendance taking becomes a task. This approach would also be helpful in security and validation of identity in multiple places like banks and government offices. 
We propose to identify the individuals by comparing their input images with that of database collected of people via Microsoft Computer Vision API. This system trains the model accordingly. The project pre-processes to enhance and to increase image contrast and reduce illumination effect. 
Extraction of features is carried out by CNN backend layers. It filters the feature maps stacked over each other. The combination of convolutional and pooling layers combined together results in better accuracy.
